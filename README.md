# SSP Key

**Secure. Simple. Powerful.**

---

## Overview


SSP Key is your **two-factor authentication (2FA)** solution for the  **[SSP Wallet](https://sspwallet.io)**. It securely holds the **secondary private key** required to construct **2-of-2 multisignature addresses** and sign transactions. With its own independent seed phrase, SSP Key operates on true blockchain protocol standards, providing fully enforced **multisignature, multi-asset accounts**.  

This **powerful** tool brings the **simplicity and security of multisignature technology** to average users, making it easier than ever to manage multisignature addresses across multiple assets. SSP Key empowers users with the highest level of protection while maintaining a user-friendly interface, ensuring anyone can benefit from robust, blockchain-based security without complexity.  


### How SSP Key and SSP Wallet Work Together

SSP Key is an essential part of the **SSP Wallet ecosystem**, enabling a **2-of-2 multisignature system** for unmatched security:
- **SSP Wallet** manages one private key.  
- **SSP Key** (on your mobile device) holds the second private key.  
Both keys are required to authorize transactions, ensuring that your funds remain secure even if one device is compromised.

## Key Features

### **Advanced Encryption**
- **Secure Storage**: User passwords, tokens and sensitive data are stored with `react-native-keychain` and further in MMKV with AES encryption provided by CryptoJS.
- **Unique Device Encryption**: Encryption is done by combining random string generated by **`crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(64))`** with user input (password or PIN), ensuring device-specific encryption.
- **Randomized Security**: Salts and initialization vectors (IVs) are randomly generated to enhance encryption robustness.
- **Performance Focused**: Avoids underperforming libraries like Cryptr, ensuring optimal functionality in React Native environments.

### **Performance and Reliability**
- Built with:
  - **React 19** and **React Native 0.78**
  - **TypeScript** for modern, type-safe development.
- Compatible with:
  - **iOS 15.1+** and **Android 7+**
- Requires **Node.js 22+** for development.
