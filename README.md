In react-native-encrypted-storage we store users password that can decrypt data in our mmkv storage
mmkv storage is data are encrypted with cryptojs library where salt and iv are randomly generated by lib default values. Other libraries such as cryptr have poor performance in react native or use unsupported crypto methods.
password consist of DeviceInfo.getUniqueID(); + users input of password/pin
