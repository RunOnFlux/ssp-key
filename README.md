SSP Key
Secure. Simple. Powerful.

The Key to your Wallet

In react-native-encrypted-storage we store users password that can decrypt data in our mmkv storage
mmkv storage is data are encrypted with cryptojs library where salt and iv are randomly generated by lib default values. Other libraries such as cryptr have poor performance in react native or use unsupported crypto methods.
password consist of DeviceInfo.getUniqueID(); + users input of password/pin 
For more information about unique id refer to <https://reactnativeexample.com/device-information-for-react-native-ios-and-android/#getuniqueid>

SSP Wallet is built using React 18, Typescript and requires Node 16+. Dev me out with yarn dev now!
